          Through internships at General Dynamics Mission Systems 
          and Centrifuge, I contributed to mission-critical systems, 
          implemented real-time object recognition, modernized 
          software architectures, and developed cross-language 
          data transfer protocols. Additionally, I have experience 
          in full-stack development and creating dynamic web platforms.
